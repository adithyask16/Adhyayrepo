Hi everyone, Kevin here. Today we're going to look at how you can take speech

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,920
and turn it into text using AI. And the really crazy thing is that it does a

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:19,680
better job than most humans. You can use it with English and 96 other languages.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,320
It works even if you have a lot of background noise. And it also works if

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,560
you have a very sick accent. The best part is that it's completely free and

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,520
also open source. Let's check out how to do this.
