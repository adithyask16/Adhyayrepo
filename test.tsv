0	5920	Hi everyone, Kevin here. Today we're going to look at how you can take speech
5920	12920	and turn it into text using AI. And the really crazy thing is that it does a
12920	19680	better job than most humans. You can use it with English and 96 other languages.
19680	25320	It works even if you have a lot of background noise. And it also works if
25320	31560	you have a very sick accent. The best part is that it's completely free and
31560	37520	also open source. Let's check out how to do this.
